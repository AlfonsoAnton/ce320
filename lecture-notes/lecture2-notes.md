##Lecture 2 (slides 49-66)

### Agile software development

- During the mid 90s people were adopting more lightweight, flexible 'agile' strategies.
    - Scrum
    - FDD
    - XP

### The Agile manifesto

- Overview:
    - Individuals and interactions over process and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive technical documentation 
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to a change over following a plan

### The Agile manifesto's 12 principles

 1. The top priority is the satisfaction of the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

 2. Accomodate changes to requirements, even if it's during the latter stages of development. Agile processes leverage
    these changes to allow the client to have a competitive advantage.

 3. Deliver working software frequently whether it's a couple of weeks or a couple of months (prefer smaller time scales)

 4. Business people as well as developers must work together daily throughout the project.

 5. Project is built with motivated individuals. We must facilitate them with the environment and support they require
    and trust them to get the job done.

 6. Face-to-face conversation is the most effective and efficient way to communicate to and within a development team. 

 7. Working software is the primary measurement of progress.

 8. Emphasis on sustainable development. Users, Sponsors and Developers must maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

 10. Simplicity, maximising the amount of work not done is essential. 

 11. The best architecture, designs and requirements come from self-organizing teams

 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become moreeffective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Extreme Programming's Value

- Courage: to make the right decisions and tell the stakeholders the truth when they need to hear it.
- Communication: give the right people the right information to maximise productivity.
- Simplicity: To discard the things we want but don't actually need.
- Feedback: learn the appropriate lessons at every possible opportunity.
- Respect: To treat ourselves and others with dignity, acknowledge success and have a mutual desire for success.


### XP in a nutshell

- Short development lifecycles
- Incremental planning approach
- Flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality, responding to changing business needs
- Reliance on automated testing from customers/qa testers as well as developers for early defect detection.

- Reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
- Reliance on an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.
- Reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals.
- Reliance on practices that works with the short term instincts of the team members and long term interests of the project.

### How XP alleviates some  risks of the development processes

- Schedule slippages:
    - Short development lifecycles means that scope of slippages is small
    - One week iterations means fast valuable customer feedback
    - Teams implement high priority features first so slippages will only be of lower value features.
    
- Cancelled projects:
    - The client/business-pall of the team chooses the smallest release that makes the most business sense.
    - This way there is less to go wrong before deploying (the most important features are tested the longest)
    - The value of the software is the greatest at all the stages [ <-- wtf does that mean?]

- Software goes sour:
    - XP creates and maintains a comprehensive suite of automated tests, which are run and rerun after every change (many times a day) to
      ensure a quality baseline.
    - XP always keeps the system in deployable condition.

- Defect rate:
    - Thanks to constant testing, defect rate is low.
    - XP tests from the perspective of programmers writing tests function-by-function and also customers writing tests
      program-feature-by-program-feature.
    
- Business Misunderstood:
    - In XP business-oriented people are first-class members of the team.
    - Project specification is continuously refined during development so learning by the customer and the team is reflected in the software.

- Business Changes:
    - XP’s short release cycle means there is less change during the development of a single release
    - During a release, the customer is free to substitute new functionality for functionality not yet completed
    
- False feature rich: 
    - XP insists that only the highest priority tasks are addressed.

- Staff turnover:
    - Excessive pressure, lack of authority and loneliness are often at the heart of job dissatisfaction.
  
    - XP gives programmers responsibility for estimating and completing their own work, teaches them how to improve their estimates, and
      respects those estimates (authority).
    

### XP Planning

- Vision reveals where the project is going and why it’s going there.
- Release Planning provides a roadmap for reaching the goal.
- The Planning Game combines the expertise of the whole team
- (including customers) to create achievable plans.
- Iteration Planning provides structure to the team’s daily activities.
- Risk Management allows the team to make and meet long-term commitments.
- Slack allows the team to reliably deliver results every iteration.
- Stories are the building blocks in the team’s plan.
- Estimating enables the team to predict how long the work will take.
- Root-cause Analysis is a useful tool for identifying the underlying
  causes of a problem.
